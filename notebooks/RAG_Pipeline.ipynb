      "taking urgent steps to fight climate change \n",
      "and working collaboratively with our suppliers \n",

      "Every year, teams across our company find new and innovative \n",

      "become carbon neutral for our global footprint, including our supply \n",
      "chain and the energy our customers use to power their devices.\n",
      "Thanks to these efforts, I’m proud to share that Apple has now cut \n",
      "our overall emissions by more than 60 percent since 2015. This \n",

      "supply chain, and today, our suppliers now support more than \n",
      "17.8 gigawatts of clean energy around the world.\n",
      "But our commitment doesn’t end there. We’re also investing in \n",
      "clean energy projects to match the energy our customers use to \n",
      "charge their devices. And with our Power for Impact program, we’ve \n",
      "launched renewable energy projects in countries including the \n",
      "Philippines, Thailand, and South Africa. By expanding access to \n",
      "safe, reliable electricity, we can protect the planet and support the \n",
      "communities most significantly impacted by climate change. \n",
      "To drive down carbon emissions even further, we’re using more \n",
      "recycled materials than ever before. We now use 99 percent \n",
      "recycled rare earth elements in the magnets across our products. \n",
      "We’ve also continued to scale the use of recycled materials like \n",
      "tungsten, aluminum, cobalt, gold, and lithium. And we’ve done \n",
      "all that while making our products even more durable and easy \n",
      "to repair, because technology that lasts longer is better for the \n",
      "environment and our customers’ wallets.\n",
      "It is amazing to see this progress come together in a single product. \n",
      "In October, we unveiled our latest carbon neutral product, Mac mini, \n",
      "which is made with more than 50 percent recycled content and \n",
      "manufactured with electricity exclusively sourced from renewable \n",
      "energy. That’s helped reduce the carbon footprint of Mac mini by \n",
      "80 percent from our business-as-usual scenario. And to balance the \n",
      "remaining emissions that can’t be avoided, we invest in high-quality, \n",
      "nature-based projects that reduce carbon in the atmosphere. \n",
      "These projects are helping restore ecosystems around the world. \n",
      "Last year, I visited an area of the Atlantic Forest in Brazil that was \n",
      "fully deforested not long ago. Thanks to the Restore Fund we \n",
      "launched with our partners, it’s now a flourishing working forest — \n",
